		<p class="content-1">Pouring my heart into words feels impossible when describing the depth of my love for you. You're more than just a girlfriend; you're my confidante, my other half, and my love. <br>

I have to apologize first for the things I've done wrong to you. It's not my intention to hurt or make you feel bad. Sorry for my stupidity and pride that always makes you upset. Always remember that <b><i>I love you</i></b> and you're the one I choose. <br>

You're the missing piece I never knew I needed, the laughter that fills the void in my heart, and the warmth that chases away the cold, a strong woman that influences my world. <br>

Thank you for every sunrise we've shared, every whispered secret, every adventure we've embarked on, and every quiet moment in between. Thank you for making me a better man simply by being the incredible independent woman you are. <br>

I promise to cherish every moment with you, to love you fiercely and unconditionally, and to be by your side through every twist and turn life throws our way.</p>
		<p class="content-2">With you, every stolen glance is a universe of unspoken desires, every touch a promise of forever. Thank you for being my everything, my love.</p>
